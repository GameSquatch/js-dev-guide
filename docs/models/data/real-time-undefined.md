# RealTimeUndefined

Real Time Undefined elements are special elements that represent that absence of a value. These values are not actually part of the model, but rather are returned when the user asks for an element that does not exists, either by its path or from its parent element.

```js
undefined
```

The value of a RealTimeNull is always `undefined`.  You can not set the value of a RealTimeUndefined element.

## Events

This element has no events since it never represents an attached value.
